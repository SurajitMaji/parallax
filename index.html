                Vidyasagar University, named after one of the most illustrious sons of Bengal as well as one of the doyens of Indian Renaissance, Pandit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, has grown out of a long cultural and educational movement in West Bengal in general and in the undivided district of Midnapore in particular. The idea of founding a University in the district was mooted by the various organizations, notably by the Regional Education Association, Midnapore, headed by Professor A.K.Gayen of IIT, Kharagpur. The Ghani Committee appointed by the U.G.C. also suggested, among others, for the setting up of a University in Midnapore on the ground of its ‘having a compact area and a manageable number of colleges’ (at that time there were 36 colleges with an enrolment of about 42,000), and also of its ‘having the great advantage of co-operation of the IIT, Kharagpur. The Committee was also of the opinion that the new University would develop on the lines suited to the needs of this backward area.

These excursions are meticulously designed to complement curriculum objectives while fostering personal growth and cultural appreciation. During educational tours, students embark on immersive journeys to diverse destinations, including historical landmarks, scientific institutions, and cultural sites. Through guided tours, interactive workshops, and experiential activities, they delve deeper into subject matter and make meaningful connections between theory and practice. Beyond academic enrichment, educational tours play a pivotal role in nurturing personal development. Traveling to unfamiliar environments encourages students to step out of their comfort zones, develop resilience, and hone interpersonal skills. Moreover, cultural immersion fosters empathy, tolerance, and respect for diversity, promoting global citizenship and interconnectedness. In essence, educational tours serve as dynamic platforms for holistic learning, where students not only acquire knowledge but also cultivate essential life skills and a broader worldview.
